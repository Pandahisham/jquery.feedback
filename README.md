# jQuery.Feedback

I create this clone of the [Branch][1]'s feedback widget on the site.
It is also being used at [CupidWithFriends][2].

## Demo

![Demo](https://raw.github.com/siong1987/jquery.feedback/master/images/jquery.feedback.gif)

## Usage

First, you have to include both `js/jquery.feedback.js` and
`css/jquery.feedback.css` files on your page.

Then, create a dom with id `feedback-anchor` on your page:

```html
<div id="feedback-anchor"></div>
```

Then, you can initialize the Feedback widget on your page via:

```coffeescript
Feedback.init
  placeholder: 'Feedback? Let us know here.'
  send_callback: ->
  thanks_message: """
  button_name: 'Send'
<p>Thanks for your feedback!</p>
<div class="indent">
  - siong1987
</div>
    """
```

* `placeholder`: the placeholder message when user sees the Feedback
widget.
* `send_callback(text)`: the callback function after the user clicks on the
Send button by returning the text in the form.
* `thanks_message`: the message the user sees after the feedback message
is sent.
* `button_name`: the send button's name.  It doesn't have to be 'Send', right?

## Help/Issues

The code is extremely simple. Just read the source code if you have any
questions. Or, you can create a GitHub issue, I will look at them as
soon as I have the time.
